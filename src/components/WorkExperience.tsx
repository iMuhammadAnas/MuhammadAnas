              For the past year, I have been enrolled in a professional software
              development course at Baitussalam PSDC, where I focused on modern
              frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
              During this time, I worked on several real-world assignments
              including a Student Management System with dynamic form handling
              and CRUD operations, a Contact Book App with local storage
              integration, and a React-based single-page assignment deployed
              online. These projects allowed me to understand key frontend
              concepts like component-based architecture, props and state
              management, and routing. I also gained experience using Git and
              GitHub for version control and followed best practices in clean,
              maintainable coding.
